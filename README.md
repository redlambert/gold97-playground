Fork I made to see how hard it was to add running shoes to the amazing 97 Reforged. It worked! Next goal is trying out the tutorial for adding individual pokemon icons in the menu (instead of the generic ones.)


# Pok√©mon Gold & Silver 97 Reforged



To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

This game aims to create what could have been a "finished" version of the Spaceworld 97 Demo. 
Based on lvl3's original Gold 97 hack.
