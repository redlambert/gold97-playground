Fork I made to see how hard it was to add running shoes to the amazing 97 Reforged. It worked! Next goal is trying out the tutorial for adding individual pokemon icons in the menu (instead of the generic ones.) I've always wanted to get into making custom sprites, and would love to try my hand at making some for the new/beta pokemon.

Credit to SourApple for all the work done prior to my lil fork, as well as for letting me use his custom sprites/icons as a base for creating new betamon icons!
Credit to Blue Emerald, solo993, Chamber, Lake, Neslug, and Pikachu25 (Polished Crystal contributors) for the majority of other pokemon icons. I used Polished Crystal's credits to get these names - if anyone would like me to credit them to specific icons, etc. please let me know!

# Pok√©mon Gold & Silver 97 Reforged



To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

This game aims to create what could have been a "finished" version of the Spaceworld 97 Demo. 
Based on lvl3's original Gold 97 hack.
